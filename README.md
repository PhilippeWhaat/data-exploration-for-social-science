# Academic Paper Text Extractor

This is a Python script that extracts the Abstract, Results, and Conclusion sections from a directory of PDF academic papers and stores them in a CSV file.

## Requirements

The script requires the following Python libraries:

- `os`
- `re`
- `pandas`
- `pdfminer.six`

You can install any missing libraries using pip. For example:
`pip install pandas pdfminer.six`

## Usage

1. Place your PDF files in a directory named `src/google_scholar` in the same directory as the Python script. The script will process all PDF files in this directory.

2. Run the script:
`python paper_extraction.py`

3. The script will create a CSV file named `papers.csv` in the same directory. This file will contain the file name, abstract, results, and conclusion of each processed PDF.

## Limitations

Due to the variability in the structure of academic papers, the script might not perfectly extract the required sections from all documents. On our corpus, composed of 150 academic papers, it stored 93.3% of Abstracts, 94% of Results and 91.3% of conclusion sections, but all academic paper that we retrieved may not have those section (manual processing is needed to confirm). More advanced techniques such as machine learning or natural language processing might be needed for accurate section extraction.

# Word Occurrences Per Page

This Python script analyzes the occurrences of a given list of words in a Word document and plots the occurrences per page in a bar chart. The script converts the Word document to a PDF file, then extracts the text from each page and counts the occurrences of each word. The resulting bar chart shows the word occurrences stacked on top of each other for easy visualization. The chart is saved as an image file, and the temporary PDF file created during the process is removed.
## Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:

- docx2pdf: for converting Word documents to PDF files
- PyMuPDF: for reading and extracting text from PDF files
- matplotlib: for creating the bar chart

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

`pip install docx2pdf PyMuPDF matplotlib`

## Usage

- Place the Word document you want to analyze in the same directory as the script. In this example, the file name is tecnolog√≠a_infraestructuras_mercados_financieros.docx. You can change the input_file variable in the script to match the name of your Word document.
- Update the words list in the script with the words you want to count.
- Run the script:

`python word_occurrences_per_page.py`

The script will create a bar chart image file named word_occurrences_per_page.png in the same directory. Open this file to see the occurrences of each word per page in the document.

## Customization

You can customize the following variables in the script to change the appearance and behavior of the plot:

- `input_file`: the name of the Word document to analyze
- `output_file`: the name of the temporary PDF file created during the process (default: same name as input_file with a .pdf extension)
- `words`: a list of words to count in the document
- `colors`: a list of colors to use for the bars in the chart
- `num_ticks`: the number of x-axis ticks to display on the chart (default: 20)
